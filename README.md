# React Portfolio Remix

The deployed version of this site can be found at [www.matthewtodor.com](https://www.matthewtodor.com)

The site has recently been converted to typescript as additional practice with the language.

The original intention of this app was to show my proficiency in React by building a React portfolio website as a homework project. It's new role is similar.

I plan to build a React portfolio that not only includes the same or similar, with the added feature of showing as many algorithms that I've completed as possible, in "real world" uses.

Made with React, Particle.js, MaterialUI, react-type-animation, and a light up keyboard.
